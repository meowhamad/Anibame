                <p>Naruto Shippuden is the second series of Naruto anime that follows the titular hero on his quest to become Hokage. Unlike the first series, Naruto is now older and has new teachers to help him through his adventure. At the same time, he
                    faces the biggest threats to the five shinobi nations and must deal with the loss of someone he considers a brother. While the original series was filled with serious issues, Shippuden dialed everything up a notch, thrusting Naruto
                    into a world of war, death, and betrayal. He,s not a kid anymore and the gloves have come off.
